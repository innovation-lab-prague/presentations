1
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,990
Ok, who would like to start?

2
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,530
May be I will start with a question.

3
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,910
Do you know who is the current biggest user of 3d printers in the industry?

4
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,430
If people have interest in playing with these printers and you do not have couple thousand euros laying around.

5
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:21,080
Do you know about community where they can try these things out?

6
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:24,120
I heard that there are some projects or possibilities to print your own printer.

7
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,040
What is your opinion about this one?

8
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:26,990
What is the real advantage for a private person like everyone to have its own.

9
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,210
Because if you buy it, you pay 25k, 50k czech couwns for a printer.

10
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,180
And what do you print? One cup for coffee, case for your iPhone and then?

11
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,790
What do you do with it?

12
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,220
And one other question to this.

13
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:59,160
For Deutsche Boerse. How could you use that in the company?

14
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:11,080
It should more fun for facility management ;-)

15
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:23,830
I would like to just add that the innovators or inovating it's not directly related to our industry.

16
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:28,840
It's about innovating everything.
It's about exploring.

17
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:33,450
It's about thinking in different way then usuall.

18
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:44,660
May be it's not related to financial industry as such, but you can create amazing things.

19
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:44,800
You can create something new. You can start next big thing.

20
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,940
Do you have another question?

21
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,470
So you think this has a future?

22
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:56,680
It's going to become next big thing?
Some time soon?

23
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,960
This is a question more to Marek, but I would say yes.

24
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,560
I can print a house with a 3d printer.

25
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,640
In China there are some experiments how to do it in one day.

26
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:18,020
What is power consumption of your printer?

27
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:02,340
It means that one day of printing is like 100 crowns per electricity?

28
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,520
You have mentioned it buing few materials you can use it with that particular printer.

29
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:25,580
Can you somehow as I seen it on TV printing chocolate, printing food?

30
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,920
Can you adjust that specific printer to print chocolate?
